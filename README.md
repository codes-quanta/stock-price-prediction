# stock-price-prediction
In this notebook, we aim to analyse and model a time series in the form of stock price analysis and forecast: 
   - create an equally weighted index with the top 10 performing stocks from the S&P500 benchmark,
   - preprocess and handle missing data,
   - perform exploratory data analysis (EDA),
   - decompose the time series in order to analyse the underlying patterns and identify trends and seasonality,
   - stationarize the data by implementing different methods and choosing the best performing model based on statistical metrics,
   - implement statistical models, both classical and more advanced, for time-series forecast,
   - perform model comparison and choose best model based on statistical metrics.
